<h1>What is Python?</h1>
Python is a programming language that’s easy to read and understand, which makes it beginner-friendly. It doesn’t need to be “compiled” before running because it’s interpreted, meaning you can quickly test and see results.
It’s object-oriented, so you can organize your code like building blocks, and it’s high-level, meaning you don’t have to worry too much about the complicated details of the computer’s hardware. Python also allows dynamic typing, so you don’t always have to declare the type of data (like numbers or text) before using it.
Because of its simple and clear syntax, Python is often used for learning to code, building apps quickly, and even connecting different systems together (like a “glue” language). It also has tons of ready-made tools called modules and packages, which make it easier to reuse code and not start from scratch.

Best of all, Python and its huge library of features are free to download, work on almost every computer, and can be shared without any cost.
